<h4 style="text-align:center;">Hi ðŸ‘‹ my unwary reader</h4>

<p>
I have been teaching JavaScript and Java since a couple of months, and by doing that I've discovered how satisfying and self-rewarding is and also how improves my understanding of it. So that's why I decided to take some of my free time to mount this site and add try to write down some of the concepts that I had to explain more oft and some others that I find interesting to talk about.
</p>

<p>
So my dear visitor, I welcome you to my CS mental palace because we are not all like Sherlock ðŸ¤“ and I really hope that these posts will help you somehow for developer career.
</p>

<p>
P.D. It is going to take some time to have some decent content, but I will use any slots of free time for this knowledge quest.
